# Movie watchlist

Project is part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path

## Overview

This is another solo project I've completed throughout Scrimba's frontend web developer path.

The purpose of this project was to create database that will take the users query and return matching results. The program will then take the results data and display it as a card for each result; title, rating, genre, plot poster, and runtime. The user has the option to add or remove any titles into a localStorage to create their own list of titles. The program is also coded in case of incorrect or empty inputs.
